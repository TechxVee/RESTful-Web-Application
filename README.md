# Architecture
For this full stack project, we used a few different types of front-end development. When users interacted with the website, Express.js was rendered to allow the user to see and interact with the HTML information presented. On the other end, the administrators used a single-page application via Angular to interact with the site. The backend used NoSQL MongoDB database because of its fast-loading times. It’s easily able to adapt with different structures. 
# Functionality
JSON is different from JavaScript in a couple ways. JSON is a data format while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON data is shown in text while Javascript is not. JSON helps render the data on the front-end and display information. On the back end, it can collect the data and store passwords and other relevant information. When rendering information on the front-end, I refactored the code, so I didn’t have to reuse code and make it easy for readability. 
# Testing
The API endpoints in this application was used to authenticate the user and authorize the user to alter information in the database. The program gets information from the local storage when authenticating and when getting passwords, they look on the backend. 
# Reflection
This course has broadened my horizons in the development world. It gave me a real understanding of how things are developed and the process it takes to develop a clean polished artifact. I’ve learned how to break large projects down into smaller ones and complete them in a timely manner. This course has allowed me to think outside the box.
